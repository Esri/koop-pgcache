## Unreleased
### Added
* Script to upgrade columns to JSONB
* Test to ensure success of idFilter

### Changed
* Using JSONB instead of JSON
* Select only calls select from the DB, it will return features if available
* Feature collections are returned as an object instead of as the first object in an array
* Info can only be retrieved by calling `getInfo`
* Removed third parameter from _insertFeature as it was not being used for the id
* Casting values to decimal before calling statistic functions

### Removed
* deleted outdated docs folder (should only be committed to gh-pages)

### Fixed
* Insert WKT with proper quote escaping

## [1.3.0] - 2015-09-15
### Added
* New methods `getWKT` & `insertWKT` for storing and retrieving well known text strings of spatial reference systems

## [1.2.0] - 2015-09-10
### Added
* order_by option accepts array of {field: order} e.g. {'total_precip': 'ASC'}

### Changed
* Stats are requested as float
* Request data from the DB as JSON instead of strings
* Remove size limitation from `host` varchar table column ([#26](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-pgcache/pull/26))

### Fixed

### Changed
* Errors are actual error objects
* Upgrade to Standard 5

### Fixed
* Style rewrites for standard bump

## [1.0.1] - 2015-06-15
### Fixed
* Geometry objects passed in as strings were not correctly being parsed in the parseGeometry method.

### Added
* better test coverage for parseGeometry

## [1.0.0] - 2015-06-15
### Added
* Created getExtent method that returns the extent of all features in the DB.

## [0.2.2] - 2015-06-14
### Fixed
* BBOX geometries from tile requests were not being handled correctly, fixed else statement by defining bbox as the input geometry.

## [0.2.1] - 2015-06-12
### Fixed
* Broken sql due to missing semicolons

### Added
* Continuous integration support via https://travis-ci.org
* Function-level documentation and doc generation via http://documentation.js.org

## [0.2.0] - 2015-06-11
### Added
* getStat supports getting a statistic from the db directly
* tests for get stat

## [0.1.6] - 2015-06-11
### Changed
* Update URLs in package.json for org change
* Improve documentation in README.md

## [0.1.5] - 2015-06-09
### Changed
* Refactored to fit [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) style

## [0.1.4] - 2015-06-08
### Changed
* Needed a better check on the value of the geohash precision when reducing precision in the DB

## [0.1.3] - 2015-05-21
### Changed
* When inserting data we now check for a fields array, if it exists we create an index on that field. Helps make queries faster.

## [0.1.2] - 2015-05-20
### Changed
* Fixed OR filters to not append a problematic 'AND' to queries

## [0.1.1] - 2015-05-07
### Changed
* Using a more optimized recursive query to get a count of distinct geohash cells at a given substring

### Added
* a series of substring indexes get placed on tables in the DB to support geohashing

## [0.1.0] - 2015-04-30
### Added
* Added support for retrieving geohash aggregations directly from the DB.

## [0.0.6] - 2015-04-28
### Changed
* Fixed the creation of geospatial indexes for socrata tables with dashed in the name and using the geojson geometry in each feature

## [0.0.5] - 2015-04-16
### Changed
* fixed an issue where geometry filters and idFilters were in conflict in the generated sql

## [0.0.4] - 2015-04-13
### Added
* Support for providers to filter queries with an idFilter param. This optional param is appended to the where clause and allows the query to filter on table id instead of property values.

## [0.0.3] - 2015-04-11
### Changed
* Better logic for `<` or `>` operators in where clauses

## [0.0.2] - 2015-04-03
### Added
* Created a new method for applying coded value domain from Esri services: applyCodedDomains - called when filtering data with fields that contain coded value domains
